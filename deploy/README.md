This directory contains sample deployment scenarios for Silicon Notes.

Because this is just a simple Python/Flask app at heart, there are _many_ ways
to successfully deploy it, not all of which can realistically be included here.
It's best to consider these as examples that serve as a starting point for
deploying to your own local server or public Internet host.

Although the author is not an expert on every application hosting
method/platform available, please feel free to file an issue if you have any
questions about integrating Silicon Notes into your stack.

What we have here, so far:

* `docker-local`: The simplest possible `docker-compose.yaml` file for bringing
* up Silicon Notes on a localhost IP on port 5000.
